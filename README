Diary 0.1
==========

Diary is a console-based diary and todo list that leverages the capabilities of
the Unix toolbox, using date, grep, less and a host of others -- as well as
your favorite text editor -- to produce a suprisingly capable tool.

See diary(1) for a more complete description and a bunch of examples.


Requirements:
--------------
diary is a shell script that uses a number of common programs.  These
include:

   bash, xprop, grep, egrep, cut, sed, cat, awk, chmod, date, expand, cp,
   diff3, rm, sort, tail, ls, xargs, and less.

Reasonably recent versions of these utilities (diary had been functional
for approximately 2 years before being publicly released).


Installation:
--------------
1.  system-wide:
   - su to root
   - Unzip and untar the tarball somewhere.
   - Customize and run install.sh

2.  local:
   - Unzip and untar the tarball somewhere.
   - copy 'diary' somewhere in your path and make it executable 
     (chmod a+rx diary).


Usage:
-------
See diary(1).
